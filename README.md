*****************STEVE'S MOVIE THEATER*******************
Welcome to Steve's Movie Theater. This application uses an API to retrieve data about movies.

*******************************************************************************************************

It allows you to view the details about said movies such as title, description and number of avaialble tickets.
This app also used JS to facilitate buying of tickets from the Theater itself. When the tickets are over, ita
shows 'Sold Out' which means the tickets are no longer available.

*******************************************************************************************************
It uses latest html and CSS to render and style the various page elements. There is use of fetch in the JavaScript
which allows the acquisition of data from the database.

*******************************************************************************************************

The database uses a JSON format and runs on a local server. This is where the data is stored.
